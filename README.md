# Vanella Macaulay Blog (Black Woman Reads)

This is a JAMStack blog built with SvelteKit (hosted on vercel), TailwindCSS and the Ghost headless CMS (hosted on heroku). Disqus was used for the comment component.

Ghost admin is used to create and manage posts, pages and users while readers can comment and access the blog hosted on vercel.
